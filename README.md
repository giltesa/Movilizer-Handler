# Movilizer Handler

It is an APK for Android that allows Movilizer to interact with the hardware of the device that it could not otherwise handle. The application will allow Movilizer to handle the laser scanner of the device, the NFC reader, generate sounds, vibrations, notifications, launch time events and other options such as weakening the graphic interface of the apk so that the user does not deconfigure it.
Likewise, almost all options are configurable from Movilizer through MEL.
